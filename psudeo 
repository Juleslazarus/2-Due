2-Due App: 

Wants: 

i want there to be a choice betweena night and day mode so the user can change 
the contrast inside the app if they're in a dark environment. 

i want to have local storage accessible to the user and to me. 

since this is an app that i genuinely want to use i want to make a button that 
prompts the user for for a password and uses an if conditional statement to allow the user to enter the admin version of the app which will be where i store all of my reminders. This will replace the need for a database until i have the knowledge to do it that way. i can also always add users that will have their own password. 

Things I'll Need To Learn For This Project: 

More in depth understanding of html forms and how to append them to the main app list. 

local storage using JS 

etc...
